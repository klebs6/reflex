# Reflex

**Reflex** is a minimalist application designed to provide users with a custom-sized, fullscreen YouTube video experience on macOS. The program allows you to overlay a fullscreen YouTube video behind semi-translucent programming terminals, enhancing multitasking and visual access to coding resources while watching content.

## Features

- **Simple UI**: Enter a YouTube URL and launch the video in a custom-sized fullscreen window.
- **Custom Overlay**: Designed to function as a background layer, making it ideal for watching videos while working on other tasks.
- **Resizable**: Adjust the video window size to meet your specific viewing needs.
